    "\n",
    "Thus far we've looked at functions in their most basic sense - blocks of reusable code that do things. Now we move on to **Functional Programming** which gives us a new suite of tools and techniques to use with functions. Some of this stuff is going to seem pretty esoteric at first so keep in mind that the end goal of all of this is to write better cleaner more concise code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The big idea here is that functions in R are treated as \"first-class citizens\" which means they can be used like any other variable. Big deal, right? But think about what that means. Functions can take other functions as arguments. Functions can return functions. Functions can call themselves (known as recursion). This gives us some extremely powerful techniques.\n",
