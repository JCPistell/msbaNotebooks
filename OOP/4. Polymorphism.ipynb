    "## Polymorphism & Duck Typing\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main benefits of OOP is it's capacity for **polymorphism** or the ability to process a method differently based on the underlying object class. We've already seen one common type of polymorphism... overriding a parent class's method with a new one. We'll now look at another form of polymorphism and a heavily used feature of python - **duck typing.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Duck typing gets its name from the expression \"If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it's a duck.\" More formally, by delaying type-checking until runtime we can achieve polymorphic behavior by simply calling an appropriate method. An example will help make this concept clear:"
