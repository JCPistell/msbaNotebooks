    "# Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Object Oriented Programming (or OOP) is probably the most common and popular **programming paradigm** in the world today. Its ubiquity means that if you plan on ever working with code after this program you will encounter it many many times. Many of the most common enterprise-level production languages (Java, C++, etc.) are object-oriented and most popular languages make use of it to some extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we press on, it's important to keep the following in mind: The purpose of OOP is to make thinking about and designing code easier. This is nothing more than a move up the tower of abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "A disclaimer: OOP is an enormous topic and we'll only have time to scratch the surface. These are deep waters and you are encouraged to explore them more on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP is all about bundling bits of code together to create **objects**. An object may contain pieces of data, commonly known as **attributes**, and procedures, commonly known as **methods.** As programmers, all we then need to worry about is getting these objects to interact with each other in useful ways. That's it!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we need to represent a dog in our code. This dog may have a few different attributes, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Name: Fido\n",
    "- Color: Black\n",
    "- isHungry: True\n",
    "\n",
    "we will also want our dog objects to be able to do stuff, so we may want the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- eat\n",
    "- bark\n",
    "- rollOver\n",
